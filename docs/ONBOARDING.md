## Architecture

## Folder Structure

We model our code repository off a certain separation of concerns -

1. Documentation
2. Packages that may potentially be published to an artifactory or the NPM registry
3. Scripts that alleviate stresses on devleopment and deployment
4. Services (web apps, backend services, etc.)
