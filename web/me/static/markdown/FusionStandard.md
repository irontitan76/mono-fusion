# The Fusion Standard

__Published:__ _April 11, 2019_

> We help our clients use technology to reshape industries and reduce the time to turn an idea into revolutionary value. In turn,they better business and lives.

In order to establish a moral business with a collaborative culture, flat organizational structure, flexible career pathways, explicit process, and overarching brand, Fusion Industries establishes **The Fusion Standard** as our living and extensible constitution and wields this constitution to determine courses of action in business commencements and transformations.

## Structure

### Divisions
All conventions, standards, guidelines, and values herein defined shall be vested in Fusion Industries, which shall consist of multiple divisions, or organizations, all focused on a single industry vertical.

Each division adopts the hierarchy as defined in the next section. Every divisional president is part of the executive team at Fusion Industries wherein the team determines company direction and strategy by logical reasoning and voting.

Of note, the division of Fusion Technology is the governing body for the technology stack used throughout the entire company with the exception of an venture or artifical intelligence arm. It has the purpose of defining the technical architecture of web applications, software design, and development workflows so that cohesiveness, or fusion, between divisions is realized.

### Hierarchy
At Fusion, we flip the organizational structure on its head. The Operating Core &mdash; those that *directly* influence offerings &mdash; are at the pyramid's apex, because we believe leaders are foundational. In other words, leaders guide their team with encouragement, give *constructive* feedback, make decisions, take responsibility, and are tasked with advancing and sharpening their team.

### Executive Leadership
The executive team is composed of the President of each division in addition to the following roles and responsibilities:

- **Chief Executive Officer - **
- **Chief Technology Officer - **
- **Chief Finance Officer - **
- **Chief Communications Officer - **
- **Chief People Officer - **

To soften the iron law of oligarchy, or inevitable tendency of decisions being made by a select few, an internal performance score voted upon by employees for their chain of command shall occur every quarter. This does not remove the oligarchial construct but instead is a check for those with decision-making power.

- If a performance score of less than 66.67% is given to a leader after 1 quarter, he or she will report to the Executive Team for a plan of action to remediate.
- If a performance score of less than 66.67% is given to a leader for 3 *consecutive* quarters, he or she will either be demoted or removed from the organization altogether. 

### Administrators
Administrators are focused on the management of the team including technical and leadership pathways.

- **Leader - ** Responsible for overseeing and leading the work of his or her team. He or she is also responsible for planning and maintaining systems, procedures, and policies that enable and encourage the optimum performance of team members.

- ** Project Leader - ** Project Leaders’ roles are multi-faceted and span teams. They are responsible for communicating deadlines and requirements for deliverables to the teams involved in an offering’s release or campaign’s strategy.

- ** Architect - ** The visionary who organizes the development effort and is ultimately responsible for the blueprint of the solution, campaign, or offering through the conversion of requirements into architectural designs.

- ** Tactician - ** The Tactician is responsible for the release cadence by ensuring all deliverables are completed, requirements are communicated, and issues are escalated.

### Operating Core
Team roles are general and applied to each realm of business for simpler advancment and career pathway traversal. Individual success and career advancement comes from a *breadth* of knowledge comprising each area of a product and/or solution. Note that the responsibilities of each role are living and extensible, but each role must be well-defined at any given time. The individuals filling these roles are expected to be the subject matter experts in team-defined topics, and must report changes to the appropriate owners.

- **Associate - ** Individuals that are at or near the beginning of their career within their respective vertical. 
Examples: Associate Software Engineer, Associate Marketing Analyst

- **&lt;Position&gt; - ** Exhibit knowledge in fundamental concepts for his or her area of focus. They have innovative minds and offer efficient solutions.
Examples: Cloud Engineer, Finance Analyst

- ** Senior - ** - Advanced understanding of his or her area of focus who offer more efficient solutions to problems.
Examples: Senior Software Engineer, Senior Designer

- ** Lead - ** - Grasp the entirety of an offering, solve problems, and are able to teach and relay any necessary information to his or her teammates and managers.
Examples: Lead Network Engineer, Lead Marketing Analyst

- ** Principal - ** - Have vision far and beyond others on his or her team. They can easily switch contexts from low-level to high-level problems and relay information efficiently. 
Examples: Principal Software Engineer, Principal Designer

## Teams

### Career Pathways
Each employee is on either a Technical Career Path ("TCP") or Leadership Career Path ("LCP"). Individuals who express interest in expanding his or her career by increasing expertise within their area of focus follow the TCP. Whereas, individuals who convey a passion for leading *people* are inducted into the LCP.

Both career pathways contain courses and certifications for an employee to gain during his tenure at the company. As an employee progresses in the coursework, is given good reviews from his or her team and manager, promotions may be given. **Note that promotions concern title changes and do not directly influence compensation increases.**

### Hiring
Fusion hires individuals that have high levels of perception, abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, spatial orientation, and analytical thinking. We place the highest value on a person's adaptability, capability, motivation, and enthusiasm rather than knowing the subject over the course of a few interviews.

Nevertheless, the interview process must challenge the candidate so that Fusion garners the brightest individuals that can produce the most value over the shortest amounts of time. A candidate is expected to have fundamental understanding of his or her area of focus as well as analyze and solve problems.

In lieu of the notions above, **The Fusion Conversation** is created to define interview process flow and content.

### The Fusion Conversation 
- Recruiter Phone Screen (compensation & clarifications)
- Online Assessment
- Video Interview (technical & behavioral)
- Onsite Interview (technical & behavioral)
- Offer or Rejection

### Compensation 
Compensation is one of the most difficult aspects for companies to define and navigate. There are countless variables to take into account including regional location, cost of living, benefits, years of experience, candidate motivation, title differences, and negotiating factors. All of which affects the bottom line. Because of this, Fusion's salary scale for any given, non-executive position is defined as follows. Executive positions are calculated differently.

- **IA - ** Industry Average
- **RE - ** *Relevant* Experience (in months)
- **GI - ** Geography Index
- **CS - ** Conversation Score

*Equation TBD*

### Onboarding
Onboarding is an essential part of a business. Companies must adopt a robust and efficient process otherwise increase a company's turnover rate, destroy a good culture, or decelerate development. Mentorship and apprenticeship is also necessary since companies should first cultivate a collaborative atmosphere.

**The Fusion Synthesis** defines a series of steps for an individual to acclimate to their team, development workflows, The Fusion Standard, and the company overall. The steps are respective of the organization, team, and position the new hire is entering into.
                
### Training
Regular training ensures employees stay on top of the latest trends, technology, and business principles. With this in mind, **The Fusion Curriculum** is a series of courses tailored for the various positions within the company. This is also used in determining title.

## Process
Process is one of the most important aspects of the business world. An ever-decreasing time to provide products and services to customers is essential to remain competitive. This not only includes the mechanisms to deliver a solution, but the build time of the hardware platforms and setup of the software stack sitting at their foundation. Our obligation is to research market trends, survey clients and customers, provide quality deliverables, return feedback to our consumers, and deliver superior solutions to our customers. How do we do overcome such a feat? By continually reforming and modernizing processes and systems.

### Communication 
To ensure the most optimal process is followed and extended, Fusion places great importance on communication. Whenever an idea is generated, an issue found, or a clarification needed, employees are expected to quickly and articulately convey the subject at hand.

Communication becomes more difficult with regional and timezone differences, so this constitution outlines the systems and steps used to prevent those communication predicaments.

One value of our company is to **Challenge Respectfully**. To accomplish that, an efficient form of communication must be attained. The following sections define the processes to optimize communication between individuals, teams, and organizations.

### Development Workflow
An explicit development workflow is essential to ensure quality deliverables. At Fusion, we believe in isomorphic design so that workflows including initial development, testing, and quality assurance is as efficient as possible. This concept also helps the definition of each of those easier.

1. **Marketing Requirements**
2. **Product Definition**
3. **Initial Server Development**
    1. Define Schema
    2. Create API functions
4. **Initial UI Development**
    1. UI Design Process
    2. Create Components and View
    3. Create Actions
    4. Implement API (if necessary)
    5. Create Reducers
    6. Update Store
5. **Unit Testing**
6. **End-to-End Testing**
7. **Quality Assurance**
8. **User Acceptance Testing**

### Delivery Mechanisms

### Project Management 
In order to anticipate the phases in a solution pipeline and best handle the erraticism in a release, businesses must track the estimated hours that each person is committed to and ensure deliverables are being completed. Agile methodologies are crucial for organizations to adjust smoothly to rapidly-changing environments, especially those with business pressures that drive teams toward faster release cadences. The benefits of a team following a Scrum framework extend to customers, vendors, development teams, product managers, and executives. For those internal consumers, it offers high visibility into the state of a development project and the areas of focus needed. For customers, it provides a more qualitative solution leading to their overall satisfaction. The expectation is this: report against your progress daily, inform proper individuals of defects when they have been vetted and verified as an issue, close down defects, and participate in Agile meetings by proposing ideas and resolutions. Remember, Agile encourages rapid and flexible response to change. Embrace it.

### Release Cadence 

### Campaign Flow

## Paradigms
### **Code**
```javascript[Hello_World]
import hello from \'world\';

export function greet() {
  const result = hello(\'World\');
  console.log(result);
  return;
}
```
