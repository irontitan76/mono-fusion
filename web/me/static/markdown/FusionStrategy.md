\n\n> "The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs." *— Vance Havner*

\n\nLet that sink in.

\n\nTo define it, a solution is a bundle of products and services (and sometimes other solutions) tailored to customer needs. It has countless interdependencies all stemming from the inclusion of the parts that make the whole. To extrapolate: A solution consists of products that are made up of devices, which, in turn, enclose components. These components contain parts, and each part is comprised of pieces such as the billions of transistors in a processor. Transistors capture the state of the machine and the firmware, software, and processes that run on top of it. Additionally, a solution’s direction is defined and influenced by market movements, management decisions, time-sensitive objectives, outbound and inbound escalations, ordering requirements, and support or service offerings.

\n\n## Start
\n\nThe Fusion Strategy is a pathway to revamp industry procedures in place today for verticals set for growth in the coming years. With ever-increasing project acceleration and ever-expanding innovation in the world today, we must optimize the way we do business. It is a living document that consists of the following tenets:

\n\n### Focus
\n\nAs far as solutions go,

\n\n- **Marketable - ** Our outward-facing teams are enabled to push our solutions into the marketplace then into data centers.

\n\n- **Serviceable - ** Services must center around solution offerings we market and sell.

\n\n- **Modular - ** Modularity enables easy customization for specific orders and placement of third-party hardware and software.

\n\n- **Extensible - ** Customers should be able to simply build on top of our solutions and expand all aspects of network, compute, etc.

\n\n- **Qualitative - ** Product seamlessly integrates with our company’s solution offerings through discussion, innovation and testing.

\n\n- **Insightful - ** Our insights should be pushing the industry forward and reference our solutions.
